      "Proto-racism" is defined as actions that display prejudice and
      stereotypes to a certain group at a time which predates the modern
      biologically-based concept of race. Aristotle's discussion of slavery is
      an example of proto-racism, and according to Benjamin Issac, professor of
      Ancient History Emeritus at Tel Aviv University, it is an{" "}

      Racism is not as overt as it used to be, but it exists in some form, which

      , where prejudice is used as a defense mechanism by frustrated people who
      blame a more disadvantaged group for the troubles they face, even when
      such troubles could stem from structural changes. For example, blaming
      immigrants for losing jobs, rather than looking at how
      globalisation/automation could have changed the economy. While such
      prejudicial thoughts are less than desirable, a respectful conversation
      between two people would make all the difference in setting these thoughts
      right. However, there are also difficulties in how different races groups
      interact.

      is when minorities gradually adopt patterns of a dominant culture, like
      fashion or language spoken. This way minorities are sometimes able to
      avoid prejudice/discrimination, but this is sometimes difficult for some.
      It is only easier when the minority group looks or sounds similar to the
      majority group. When it is difficult, interacting becomes a chore, and

    <h2>Moving Towards A Better Future</h2>
    <p className="information">
      Black Musician, Daryl Davis, managed to get in contact and have an
      interview with Ku Klux Klan leader, Roger Kelly. Even though Kelly let
      Davis know that Davis is inferior to him due to the colour of his skin,
      Davis tried to learn where his perceptions came from rather than getting
      apprehended. Davis and Kelly, despite their differences, were never
      physically violent with each other. Due to this, both of them formed a
      level of respect for each other. Their friendship was undoubtedly odd,
      such that CNN covered a story regarding the both of them. In the CNN
      excerpt, Kelly can be seen portraying immense respect for Davis, more
      respect than he had for his other Klan members. He says "at least he
      respects me to sit down and listen to me, and I respect him to sit down
      and listen to him". Davis, in his{" "}

      , shares that as a result of that respect, Kelly, overtime, began to
      rethink his ideologies and eventually renounce his position as Klan
      leader. Davis mentions that people learn racism through dialogue, and it
      is also through dialogue people un-learn it.
