    <h2>Brief History</h2>
    <p className="information">
      When discussing slavery, Greek philosopher, Aristotle, stated that Greeks
      are free by nature, and non-Greeks are slaves by nature. Non-Greeks were
      also referred to as "barbarians" who have strong bodies but are not
      intelligent, thus making them unfit for leadership positions.

    <h2>Brief History</h2>
    <p className="information">
      "Proto-racism" is defined as actions that display prejudice and
      stereotypes to a certain group at a time which predates the modern
      biologically-based concept of race. Aristotle's discussion of slavery is
      an example of proto-racism, and according to Benjamin Issac, professor of
      Ancient History Emeritus at Tel Aviv University, it is an important
      precursor to mordern racism.

    <h2>Brief History</h2>
    <p className="information">
      Such proto-racism and ethnicity-based prejudice that is based on
      Aristotle's identification can be seen in multiple historical events. Such
      historical events include Anglo Saxons believing their pursuit of liberty
      is incomparable to other nations, making them superior to other races, as
      well as the holocaust where the idea of a "pure" race should survive.
      While the world has made strides in eliminating such ideologies, racism
      continue to exist in different ways currently.

    <h2>Presence in Today's Context</h2>
    <p className="information">
      Racism is not as overt as it used to be, but it exists in some form, which
      is usually along the lines of "prejudice" - a preconceived opinion that is
      not based on reason. In the U.S., Megan Francis shared about the time she
      almost missed her flight when security guards accused her of bringing a
      weapon into the airport. The "weapon" was merely a plastic ring, to which
      the security guards insisted that she was lying and that "people of her
      kind are dangerous". In the U.K., Chuks Nwaobasi shared about incidents
      when he used to be on the receiving end of racist behaviour, like name
      calling. When he tried bringing attention to this matter, he received
      comments such as "it does not happen that often", or "you\'re being too
      sensitive". Such prejudicial behaviour can also been in Singapore, where a
      30-year-old Chinese man physical assaulted and made an offensive racial
      slur to an Indian woman.',

    <h2>Presence in Today's Context</h2>
    <p className="information">
      There are a few theories as to why racism exist in today's context. One
      such theory is scapegoat theory, where prejudice is used as a defense
      mechanism by frustrated people who blame a more disadvantaged group for
      the troubles they face, even when such troubles could stem from structural
      changes. For example, blaming immigrants for losing jobs, rather than
      looking at how globalisation/automation could have changed the economy.
      While such prejudicial thoughts are less than desirable, a respectful
      conversation between two people would make all the difference in setting
      these thoughts right. However, there are also difficulties in how
      different races groups interact.

    <h2>Difficulties in Interacting</h2>
    <p className="information">
      Among some of the categories sociologists have termed how different racial
      groups interact, assimilation and segregation is two of them. Assimilation
      is when minorities gradually adopt patterns of a dominant culture, like
      fashion or language spoken. This way minorities are sometimes able to
      avoid prejudice/discrimination, but this is sometimes difficult for some.
      It is only easier when the minority group looks or sounds similar to the
      majority group. When it is difficult, interacting becomes a chore, and
      this is where segregation comes in. Segregation is the phsyical and social
      seperation of categories of people, where people work and interact with
      others who are of the same race.",
